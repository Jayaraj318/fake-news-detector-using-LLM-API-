      <h2>About Fake News Detection using Gemini AI</h2>
      <p>
        This project uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze news articles and detect whether they are real or fake.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system is designed to fight misinformation by leveraging the power of large language models to fact-check news content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, a Chrome Extension is available to provide quick access to fake news detection while browsing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to provide a trustworthy research tool that helps users discern the truth in the news they consume.
